5. Add a feature that allows the player to save their progress and resume it later.
6. Add a feature that allows the player to play the game offline.
7. Add exp and leveling system that rewards the player for playing the game and completing quizzes, but the amount of exp gained from a specific category slows down as the player progresses through the game, the amount of exp gained from a specific category also depends on the player's performance stats.
8. Add a profile button that allows the player to view their progress and stats and exp progression rate for each category.
9. Add Adventure mode that bottoms up the entire material in a perfect pedagogical order of the material, ex: instead of asking the player 120 separated questions, the questions go on by the order of the material instead, the question should lead the player with perfect bottom up understanding of the material to ensure a 100% pass rate of the Adventure mode.
